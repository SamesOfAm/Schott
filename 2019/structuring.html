        <p>Due to the increasing prevalence of more complex and demanding technologies for in-vitro diagnostic biochips, there is a growing demand for high-quality glass substrates especially in terms of miniaturization.
<br><br>
            To address this demand, Schott, through its NEXTERION® family of products offers a unique solution for even the most demanding needs. Particularly, relevant is Schott´s new PreScora solution. Using its unique laser technology, PreScora enables the ability to manufacture extremely small and precise glass biochips in such a way to be cost comparable to polymers but with the quality and performance advantages of glass.
            <br><br>         
            In addition, PreScora substrates can be combined with Schott NEXTERION®’s other key features such as high-quality homogenous coatings and customized markings to maximize diagnostic performance. So, whether as a standalone application or as a component in a diagnostic consumable, Schott’s PreScora solution opens new possibilities for your diagnostic needs.
